The following code uses Tailwind's `container` utility class, but the container doesn't behave as expected, not occupying the full width available on different screen sizes.  The issue is particularly noticeable on larger screens where the content remains centered and doesn't stretch to the edges as intended.

```html
<div class="container mx-auto">
  <p>This text should fill the available width.</p>
</div>
```
