To fix this issue, add the `max-w-none` class to your container to remove the maximum width restriction.

```html
<div class="container mx-auto max-w-none">
  <p>This text now fills the available width.</p>
</div>
```

This ensures that the container will always occupy the full width of its parent element, resolving the problem of the content remaining centered on larger screens.
